Understanding Mindi Cot (Mindikott)
Mindi Cot is a trick-taking card game played with 4 players in two teams. The objective is to win as many tricks as possible, with special emphasis on capturing the 'Mindi' cards (usually the Jack cards). In the Band hukum mode, the trump suit is fixed and not revealed until certain conditions are met.

Project Architecture
1.‚Å† ‚Å†Model Classes
Card.java: Represents a single card with attributes like suit and rank.

Deck.java: Manages the collection of cards, shuffling, and dealing.

Player.java: Represents a player with a hand of cards and methods to play a card.

Game.java: Manages the overall game logic, including turns, scoring, and determining the winner.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†View Components
MainActivity.java: The main activity that initializes the game and handles user interactions.

activity_main.xml: Layout file containing the UI elements like player hands, played cards area, and scores.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Controller
Handles the interaction between the Model and View, updating the UI based on game state changes.

üìù Step-by-Step Implementation
1.‚Å† ‚Å†Designing the Card Model
Create a Card.java class with the following attributes:

Suit: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades.

Rank: 2 through Ace.

isMindi: Boolean to indicate if the card is a Mindi (Jack).

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Creating the Deck
In Deck.java, initialize a standard 52-card deck, shuffle it, and provide methods to deal cards to players.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Player Class
Player.java should manage the player's hand, allowing adding and removing cards, and selecting a card to play.

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Game Logic
Game.java will manage the flow of the game:

Dealing cards to players.

Managing turns and enforcing rules.

Handling the Band hukum logic: the trump suit is fixed but hidden until a player cannot follow suit.

Tracking scores and determining the winner.

5.‚Å† ‚Å†User Interface
In activity_main.xml, design the UI to display:

Each player's hand (for human players, show cards; for AI, hide cards).

Area to display played cards.

Scores and game status messages.

6.‚Å† ‚Å†Integrating Cursor AI
Use Cursor AI to assist in writing and debugging code:

Generate boilerplate code for classes.

Assist in writing complex methods, like determining the winner of a trick.

Debugging and optimizing code snippets.
